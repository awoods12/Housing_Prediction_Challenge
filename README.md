# Housing_Prediction_Challenge

Jupyter notebook tutorial for regression on Fannie Mae housing data.

This repository shows an example of how to obtain a predictor for some indicator from the Fannie Mae public API datasets. 

You can view the completed Jupyter notebook in the html version or you can view it from GitHub if you open the .ipynb file.

If you want to edit and run pieces of the Jupyter notebook:
1. Install python3 and run 'pip install jupyter' in the terminal. 
2. From there run 'jupyter notebook' which will start the client. 
3. You can then select the .ipynb file that you downloaded from this repo, and you will be able to edit and run the notebook.
